1. Data Insights 

Top-Selling Models & Colors 

Certain makes and models dominate sales (e.g., Toyota Corolla, BMW X5, Ford Fiesta). 

Popular colors (black, white, blue, red) consistently appear in the top-selling combinations. 

Customers show strong preferences for specific make-model-color bundles. 

2. Revenue Drivers 

High-volume models generate steady revenue, but some premium models deliver higher margins despite lower unit sales. 

Average selling price varies significantly by make and model, showing opportunities for pricing optimization. 

3. Depreciation & Usage 

Strong correlation between odometer readings and sellingprice: higher mileage reduces resale value. 

Year of manufacture impacts pricing — newer cars command higher average selling prices. 

4. Regional & Location Trends 

Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal regions show strong sales volumes. 

Dealerships in urban centers (Durban, Cape Town, Brakpan) outperform smaller locations. 

Regional differences highlight where inventory allocation should be prioritized. 

5. Customer Preferences 

Growing interest in digital-first purchasing and EV adoption. 

Declining brand loyalty — customers are open to exploring new makes if value and transparency are clear. 

Personalization and transparent pricing are key drivers of trust.
